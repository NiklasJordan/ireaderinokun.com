<p>LE Retail Operations Management is a luxury retail consultancy firm.</p>


<p>I was involved as both the designer and developer on this project. Although the deisgn of the website was my own, the graphic design (Logo and Background Design) was created by <a href="http://tmadesignwork.com/" target="_blank">TMA Designs</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of the design was to create a single page website that didnâ€™t feel like the typical single page website, that being one long page. Because the actual content was so minimal, I was able to go for a more unique design. I also had the additional constraint of not being able to use any images. This was a bit of a struggle for me, as I love to incorporate images in my designs, but it forced me to think differently and come up with this unique layout.</p>
